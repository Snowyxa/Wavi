# Release Notes - Wavi v1.1.3

**Release Date**: May 27, 2025  
**Focus**: Advanced Smoothing & Accessibility Improvements

## üéØ What's New

### ‚ú® Advanced Smoothing System
- **Multi-layer smoothing** reduces cursor jitter for improved accessibility
- **Dead zone technology** (0.003 radius) eliminates micro-movement noise
- **Velocity-based smoothing** prevents sudden direction changes
- **Position history averaging** over 8 frames for temporal stability

### üß† Smart Movement Processing
- **Stabilization detection** - Recognizes when hand is steady
- **Movement threshold filtering** - Ignores insignificant movements
- **Configurable smoothing parameters** for different user needs
- **Temporal consistency** - Weighted averaging of recent positions

### ‚ôø Accessibility Enhancements
- **Motoric issue support** - Specifically designed for users with hand tremors
- **Reduced fatigue** - Smoother movement requires less precise hand control
- **Improved precision** - Stable cursor positioning for accurate targeting
- **Customizable sensitivity** - Adaptable to individual user needs

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient position history management** with automatic cleanup
- **Reduced debug logging** (10% sampling rate) for better performance
- **Smart variable reset** on tracking stop/start
- **Optimized smoothing algorithms** for real-time processing

### Code Enhancements
- `applySmoothingToMovement()` - Hand position smoothing with dead zone
- `calculateSmoothedPosition()` - Cursor position smoothing with weighted averaging
- `addToPositionHistory()` - Temporal position tracking and management
- Enhanced `stopTracking()` function with complete state reset

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Resolved Issues
- **ISS-005**: Jittery cursor tracking affecting users with motoric issues
- **Micro-movement noise** causing distracting cursor shake
- **Sudden position jumps** during natural hand movements
- **Inconsistent tracking behavior** across different usage sessions

## üìã Configuration

### Smoothing Parameters (Developer Configurable)
```javascript
smoothingFactor: 0.7           // Higher = more smoothing (0.1-0.9)
maxHistoryLength: 8            // Frames to average for position history
movementThreshold: 0.005       // Minimum movement to register
velocitySmoothing: 0.8         // Smooth velocity changes
stabilizationThreshold: 3      // Frames needed for "stable" detection
deadZoneRadius: 0.003          // Dead zone around current position
```

## üîÑ Migration Notes

### Automatic Updates
- No user action required - smoothing is enabled by default
- Existing settings and preferences are preserved
- All previous functionality remains unchanged

### Compatibility
- **Backward Compatible** - Works with all existing configurations
- **No Breaking Changes** - All previous APIs remain functional
- **Enhanced Performance** - Improved experience on all supported websites

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### For Users with Motoric Issues
1. **Test hand steadiness** - Verify reduced cursor shake
2. **Try precise targeting** - Test small UI element interaction
3. **Extended usage** - Check for reduced hand fatigue
4. **Different environments** - Test under various lighting conditions

### For All Users
1. **Cursor stability** - Notice smoother movement patterns
2. **Click accuracy** - Verify maintained precision with new smoothing
3. **Performance** - Confirm no reduction in responsiveness
4. **Website compatibility** - Test on YouTube, social media, and complex sites

## üìû Support

If you experience any issues with the new smoothing system:

1. **Check version** - Ensure you're running v1.1.3
2. **Restart tracking** - Stop and start tracking to reset smoothing variables
3. **Environment optimization** - Ensure good lighting and stable camera position
4. **Report issues** - Use GitHub issues for any problems or feedback

## üîÆ Coming Next

### v1.2.0 Preview
- **Scroll functionality** - Horizontal hand movement for page scrolling
- **Gesture customization** - User-configurable gesture settings
- **Performance monitoring** - Built-in performance metrics
- **Accessibility presets** - Pre-configured settings for different needs

---

**Wavi v1.1.3** represents a significant step forward in making hand gesture control accessible to users with diverse motor abilities while maintaining the responsive, intuitive experience for all users.
