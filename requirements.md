- [ ] Implement client-side processing (no server communication)
- [ ] Achieve performance target: reaction time under 500ms per frame
- [ ] Ensure functionality in normal lighting conditions
- [ ] Implement fallback mechanism for webcam loss

### ðŸŽ¨ User Interface Requirements
- [ ] Create extension popup with settings:
  - [ ] Activation/pause toggle
  - [ ] Sensitivity controls
  - [ ] Calibration options
- [ ] Ensure UI compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- [ ] Design intuitive user feedback system

### ðŸ”§ Key Features
- [ ] Implement gesture-to-browser-action conversion:
  - [ ] DOM event triggering (click, scroll, keypress)
  - [ ] Robust handling of various web page elements
  - [ ] Support for forms and dynamic content
- [ ] Create adaptive system for:
  - [ ] Different user movements
  - [ ] Various lighting conditions
  - [ ] User-specific calibration

### ðŸ”’ Privacy and Security
